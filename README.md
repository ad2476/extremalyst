extremalyst
===========

Find absolute extrema of surfaces in 3-space using gradient ascent/descent.

This is most definitely a WIP.

### Current Status:
* Working CAS (computer algebra system) - for the most part
* Parses gradient vector passed in component notation <Fx, Fy>, theta-pair in coordinate notation (theta1, theta2)
* Converts into RPN, substitutes theta-pair and evaluates the RPN equation
* TODO: Implement gradient descent.
