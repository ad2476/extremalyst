extremalyst
===========

Find absolute extrema of surfaces in 3-space using gradient ascent/descent.

This is most definitely a WIP.

### Current Status:
* Parses (most) expressions passed as partial derivatives to gradient
* TODO: Everything else. Starting with RPN calculator and variable substitution system.
